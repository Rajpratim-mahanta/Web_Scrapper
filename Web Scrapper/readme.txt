This Python tool allows you to scrape information from websites of interest, parse HTML content, and store the extracted data in a structured format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests library
- beautifulsoup4 library
- csv library (included in Python's standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `main.py` file in a text editor.
2. Modify the `urls` list in the `main()` function to include the URLs of the websites you want to scrape.
3. Run the program by executing the following command:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. The program will scrape each website, extract the specified information, and save it to a CSV file named `scraped_data.csv`.
5. The extracted data will be stored in a structured format, with each row representing a website and its corresponding data.

## Customization

- You can customize the data extraction logic by modifying the `scrape_website()` function in the `main.py` file. Adjust the HTML element selectors to match the specific elements you want to extract from the websites.
- To store the data in a different format or perform additional processing, you can modify the `save_to_csv()` function or create your own functions as needed.
